```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(bookdown.internal.label = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.extra = 'style="display:block; margin:auto;"')  # center
```

I recently passed the [AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900){target="_blank"} exam. To help study, I created a set of flashcards using a reveal.js presentation from an Excel file of terms/definitions. The repo is [here](https://github.com/WilliamTylerBradley/az_900){target="_blank"}, with the presentation found [here](https://williamtylerbradley.github.io/az_900/az_900_flashcards.html#/){target="_blank"} The terms come from the official skills measured document for 2021.

The R code is pretty simple. To set up the presentation, you’ll need the latest version of the revealjs package (Any version of reveal.js past version 4 should work for the r-stack option.). The following front-matter setup should work fine. You can turn on the shuffle option to shuffle the cards every time the document is re-knitted.

```{r page_setup}

output: 
  revealjs::revealjs_presentation:
    incremental: false
    transition: 'none'
    background_transition: 'none'
    slide_level: 1
    css: custom.css
    reveal_options:
      controls: false
      slideNumber: false
      progress: false
      # shuffle: true # uncomment to randomize cards
    self_contained: false

```

The following code is the only markdown needed. It’ll read in the Excel file and loop through the rows to create the presentation. Each flashcard is a different slide. The term is the first fragment with the definition second because the r-stack places them on top of each other. The data-fragment-index is the same for both, so the term will fade out while the definition fades in on the same click. The line of breaks moves the term up a little. I just think it looks a little better.

````
```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}`r ''`
library(readxl)
terms <- read_excel(here::here("az 900 Skills.xlsx"))

for(i in 1:nrow(terms)) {
term <- terms$Term[i]
definition <- terms$Definition[i]

cat(paste("
  <section class=\"center\">\n
  <div class=\"r-stack\">\n
  <div class=\"fragment fade-out\" data-fragment-index=\"1\"><b>",
  term,
  "</b><br> \n <br> \n <br>
  </div>\n"))

cat(paste(
  "<div class=\"fragment fade-in\" data-fragment-index=\"1\">",
  definition,
  "</div>\n
  </div>\n
  </section>"))

}
```
````

There are opportunities to color the slides based on the subject area, add additional information in the notes, or filter the terms.
